# FOCUS-ON-TODAY
I developed an app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to help users manage their daily tasks. The app allows users to add up to three tasks each day. Each task is displayed with a checkbox, which users can check once the task is completed. This feature helps users track their progress and ensures that their daily priorities are managed effectively. The app's user-friendly interface makes it easy to input, view, and complete tasks, aiding in better organization andÂ productivity.
